Dave Matthews and the Existential Realization of the Matrix

In this game you play Dave Matthews, a jack-of-all-trades man with a passion for
McDonalds, Ballpits, Skeeball, and butchering cows. However, you do none of this
in this game as you play a frail man realizing he is nothing more than what the
machine he lives in says he is.
